**-Some personal things**

✦ I often, very often, tend to distance myself from my friends or people I know online. I have a bad habit of fixating on the friends I interact with online, to the point where it has become unhealthy for me. Because of this, I don't engage much with the people I've added, unless we are close. I never interact first with my friends because I feel nervous about possibly annoying them to the point where they no longer want anything to do with me. Additionally, since I sometimes often feel lonely on PonyTown and struggle to have proper social interactions despite yearning for them, I become unhealthily jealous over and possessive over the friends I am close to, which is overall affecting my mental state. I keep my friend requests off, and do not add anyone unless I know, or feel comfortable with you.

✦ I sometimes go over to people for C+H, but I always feel a lot of hesitation before I am able to work up the courage to go sit by someone. I always accept C+H though, and I am willing to sit there for hours doing so depending on the time. If it is night for me, I might accidently fall asleep while afk.

✦ With my social activity on Ponytown, I am *almost* always silent, ***BUT*** I am starting to socialize more with others, despite it sometimes being hard. I will only ever speak if you're cosplaying something I like, if the game I am playing requires me to speak, If i am with friends, or through whispers. If you try to speak to me outside of whispers, I will not respond 80% of the time because I am frequently offtab. I always play: FTS, GTC, FASHION ROULETTE, MAFIA

✦ Additionally, i'm very sorry if I may frequently come off as rude, or mean. I truly do not mean to - as I am not that kind of person, and have an issue with controling my tone through text. I also take things seriously and fail to realize when someone is trying to say something in a joking manner - so please be cautious about that. Or i may be being mean on purpose if you annoy the fuck out of me and won't leave me alone - at that point I really have no patience to continue trying to be nice.

**-Random silly things** (ill add more when i feel like it) 

✦ I LOVE orcas!! they're my favorite animals, and I love everything about them. I Also like marine life in general, and want to be a marine biologist in the future!

✦ My favorite book is called "The Wrap Up List" and it is amazing!!

✦ I love drawing, and it is one of my favorite hobbies. Unfortunately though I do not feel comfortable in posting most of my art, as I am a victim to art theft.

✦ When speaking in ponytown, I usually send my messages in short, seperate parts because I am a slow typer when it comes to typing out longer responses.

✦ My Favorite characters (as of right now) Are Pitaya Dragon, Longan Dragon, Shadow milk, Mikaela Hyakuya, Malleus Draconia, and Hua Cheng

✦ (Heavy) Kins -> Mikaela Hyakuya and Idia Shroud
