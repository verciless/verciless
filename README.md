<p align="center">Idia is a shy and withdrawn person with a dark outlook on life. When in public, Idia can get anxious rather easily. He has a tendency to stutter when speaking with unfamiliar people, so he is sometimes seen using his tablet to communicate. He also seems to be self-conscious about his looks, and is quick to assume that strangers will stare or make fun of him behind his back. In general, he expects a negative outcome from any social situation, so he would rather avoid them altogether. Despite all of this, Idia acts very differently under certain circumstances. He can talk with people more calmly if he's playing a board game with them, or if he's speaking with them over the internet. Moreover, he can speak quickly and enthusiastically about his hobbies or interests, greatly contrasting his usual demeanor. When he isn't talking to someone face to face, whether it be through a screen or behind a wall, he can speak clearly and quite bluntly. This sometimes backfires on him, though, as he can get a bit confrontational and say things he doesn't mean in the process.</p>
