This github is unfinished and currently in the works, so in the meantime, enjoy my oc Zero! <3 (whisper me and tell me what you think of this little goober bc i'd love love love to hear) - random lore below him

![IMG_3912](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c1d3663-6c63-4678-aafa-65686ed203a6)

Rushed lore because i need to remember:
Uhm.. Zero was created as the 2nd ever god to exist in a newly created universe, created to be the personification and ruler of Antimatter - along side the gods of space and time. He was really more of a prototype, so there were many errors within his being; he lacked control of his emotions, and one day mysteriously lost control of himself and tried killing the other 3 gods, including time and space, and his ultimate creator. After having brought havoc and genocide to earth in his fit of rage, he was eventually banished into a void where he spent thousands (or millions i havent decided yet) of years in confinement by himself. After being freed by a human he now seeks revenge on his creator for regecting him 👍
