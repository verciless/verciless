https://verciless.atabook.org/ <-- Leave me a message here. I do cosplay requests (as in, i have run out of cosplay ideas, so i might make a cosplay for you if ya want me to) and I take song reccomendations as well - just send a link a long with it.

This github is unfinished and currently being worked on - hence for why it seems a bit messy.

**-Some personal things**

I often, very often, tend to distance myself from my friends or people I know online. I have a bad habit of fixating on the friends I interact with online, to the point where it has become unhealthy for me. Because of this, I don't engage much with the people I've added. I never interact first because I feel nervous about possibly annoying my friends to the point where they no longer want anything to do with me. Additionally, since I usually feel lonely on PonyTown and struggle to have proper social interactions despite yearning for them, I become unhealthily jealous and possessive over the friends I am close to, which is overall affecting my mental state.

I sometimes go over to people for C+H, but I always feel a lot of hesitation before I am able to work up the courage to go sit by someone. I always accept C+H though, and I am willing to sit there for hours doing so.

With my social activity on Ponytown, I am almost always very silent. I will only ever speak if you're cosplaying something I like, if the game I am playing requires me to speak, If i am with friends, or through whispers. If you try to speak to me outside of whispers, I will not respond 80% of the time because I am frequently offtab. I always play: FTS, GTC, FASHION ROULETTE

Additionally, i'm very sorry if I may frequently come off as rude, or mean. I truly do not mean to - as I am not that kind of person, and have an issue with controling my tone through text. I also take things seriously and fail to realize when someone is trying to say something in a joking manner - so please be cautious about that.

**-Random silly things** (ill add more when i feel like it) 

I LOVE orcas!! they're my favorite animals, and I love everything about them. I Also like marine life in general, and want to be a marine biologist in the future!

My favorite book is called "The Wrap Up List" and it is amazing!!

I love drawing, and it is one of my favorite hobbies. Unfortunately though I do not feel comfortable in posting most of my art, as I am a victim to art theft.

My Favorite characters (as of right now) Are Pitaya Dragon, Longan Dragon, And Shadow milk! (Also slightly including Ananas Dragon)
